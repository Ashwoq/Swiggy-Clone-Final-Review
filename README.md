# Swiggy-Clone-Final-Review(50 days work progress)  
I have to develop a food delivery website for internship 
so I'm trying to clone a swiggy website* with some limitation

## Deployment
Click here(only frontend deployment) -> https://ashwoq.github.io/Swiggy-Clone-Final-Review/

AWS deployment(Full MEAN Stack App) -> http://swiggy-env.eba-63ymcxb3.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

Read the Error

## Progress
So far the chennai was only the available district so user can select or search chennai in the starting home page 
then the user can able to see the some hotel but only one hotel is available right now(Babal Da Punjabi Dabha) so user can select that hotel 
or user can go to the search option and type Babal Da Punjabi Dabha and select the hotel
then user can see the available dishes , but in order to add those into the cart 1st user should signup/login 
after user successfully authenticated then they can add the item into the cart 
then they can click the checkout option and they need to add the address and  select the payment method...

# Error
In my locolhost the ratio is fine but in deployment only the ratio is different for some pages...

which means some users can see blank vertical white spacre in right side of some pages and some users can see the overflow of some pages 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In github im not able to deploy my full app which include backend logics... 

so i decide to deploy my full MEAN Stack app in AWS so now user can really signup/Login and access all functionality

AWS deployment Link -> http://swiggy-env.eba-63ymcxb3.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
